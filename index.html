<h1>Prototype 1:</h1>

<p>
First prototype using the Google Docs style commenting model, where clicking
a card brings it inline with its annotation. Each card is fully visible and
a card above pushes all cards below down until there is enough space.

</p>

<h1>Prototype 2:</h1>

<p>
A second crude prototype to explore what would happen if many annotation sat
at their exact positions but surrounding cards moved away when activated.
</p>

</p>

<h1>
Prototype 3:
</h1>

<p>
An extension of prototype 1 but with comments added to the top of the viewer
and an improved focused state.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="./viewer-3/">viewer-3/</a>
</p>

<h1>
Prototype 4:
</h1>

<p>
Same as prototype 3 but with triple the number of cards.

<h1>
Prototype 5:
</h1>

<p>
Same as prototype 2 but with triple the number of cards.

<h1>
Prototype 6:
</h1>

<p>
This is a development from prototype 3 that moves the comments to the bottom
of the page at all times.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h1>
Prototype 7:
</h1>

<p>
This adds toggles for the comments section to allow them to be turned on and
off. The idea being the same for annotation too.

</h1>

<p>

cases from prototype 3.
