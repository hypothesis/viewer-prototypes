Prototype 1:

First prototype using the Google Docs style commenting model, where clicking
a card brings it inline with its annotation. Each card is fully visible and
a card above pushes all cards below down until there is enough space.

Prototype 2:

A second crude prototype to explore what would happen if many annotation sat
at their exact positions but surrounding cards moved away when activated.

Prototype 3:

An extension of prototype 1 but with comments added to the top of the viewer
and an improved focused state.

Prototype 4:

Same as prototype 3 but with triple the number of cards.

Prototype 5:

Same as prototype 2 but with triple the number of cards.

Prototype 6:

This is a development from prototype 3 that moves the comments to the bottom
of the page at all times.

Prototype 7:

This adds toggles for the comments section to allow them to be turned on and
off. The idea being the same for annotation too.

Positioning Demo:

A more complete positioning example that takes into account some of the edge
cases from prototype 3.
